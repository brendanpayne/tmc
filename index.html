            <h2>01/19/2016 - 06/11/2024</h2>
            <p>
              On June 11, 2024, Discord Janitors (who in fact do it for free) decided to delete our Discord
              server after deleting my account two months prior. After 8 years of using this service with no
              issues, all it took was being a moderator of a dead server to get my account deleted and all
              the memories made over the years erased.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, I'm not sure if I want to put in the effort to rebuild what was lost. Especially with 
              all the other stuff in my life that I am dealing with right now. That and knowing it can be taken 
              away at any moment under the guise of (((community guidelines))). For now, you will find a 
              link to the new Discord server below if you want to join to at least keep in touch with me and 
              the others. More info will be there when the time comes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks for the memories gamers.
